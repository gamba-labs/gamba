# 🎰 Apps

Gamba Apps/Platforms serve as frontends that interact with the Gamba on-chain Program, enabling users to participate in betting games.

Owners can generate revenue by associating a Solana address with each play on their App (referred to as a "creator address"). This allows them to leverage Gamba's liquidity across different tokens and earn fees on plays, all without assuming any personal risk.

Setting up a betting app, such as a game or casino, merely requires a simple webpage, eliminating the need for backend deployments.
